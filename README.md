## The little story behind Socicon
Socicon was created to give people an easy way to customize social icons.  
**Made in France**  
In France, we are very proud of our food (sometimes a bit too much)! Socicon refers to the [saucisson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saucisson), a sort of dry sausage that we eat as an aperitif with a drink, with cheese, in a packed lunch, well we can really eat saucisson any time, anywhere and with anyone!

## Desktop usage
To use Socicon in desktop programs, you can install the TTF font. In order to copy the character associated with each icon, refer to the text box at the bottom right corner of each glyph in demo.html. The character inside this text box may be invisible; but it can still be copied. You can go to [Socicon Cheatsheet](http://socicon.teddypayet.com/icons) and copy-paste icons from there to your desktop program.

## Dear creators of the icon font

First of all, I would like to express my deep respect for your exceptional work in developing this icon font. Your contribution has been truly remarkable.

I am pleased to inform you that I have taken over the updating and maintenance of this icon font which has unfortunately not been maintained since the end of 2019. Recognizing the importance of your creation and keen to preserve its legacy, I took the initiative to set up a structure on GitHub to monitor the progress of the project and manage requests.

I would like to emphasize that this initiative is motivated by the greatest respect for your work and your original vision. I firmly believe that by collaborating, we can revive this icon font and allow it to continue to enrich digital experiences around the world.

I warmly invite you to contact me if you wish to participate in this new phase of the project. Your expertise and perspective will be extremely valuable in ensuring that Socicon stays true to its original vision while meeting the evolving needs of the community.
